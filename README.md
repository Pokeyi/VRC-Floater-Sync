UTC-synced bobbing and rocking for VRChat.

## Overview
VRC Floater Sync is a single configurable UdonSharp behaviour that can be used to manage synced bobbing and rocking motions for multiple game objects.

It is intended to be efficient and relatively simple to use without the need for any additional editor scripts or dependencies outside of UdonSharp. All configuration can be done within the Unity Inspector window without the need for any programming, Udon, or SDK knowledge. That said, the source code is cleanly-organized and commented in the hopes of also being a good learning tool.

### Requirements
Errors regarding functions not being exposed likely mean you need an updated version of the SDK or UdonSharp.
- [VRChat Worlds SDK3](https://vrchat.com/home/download) (Tested: v2021.11.8)
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp) (Tested: v0.20.3)

### Recommended
Other useful VRChat world-creation tools that I will always recommend.
- [World Creator Assistant](https://github.com/Varneon/WorldCreatorAssistant) (SDK & Package Management)
- [CyanEmu](https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanEmu) (Unity-Window Testing)
- [Udon Platform Hook](https://github.com/Superbstingray/UdonPlayerPlatformHook) (Moving-Platform Functionality)

### Setup
Make sure you have already imported the VRChat Worlds SDK and UdonSharp into your project.
- Download the latest [Unity Package](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Floater-Sync/releases) and import it into your project.
- A pre-configured example prefab is included that you can drop into your scene if you like.
- Create and select an empty game object and add the P_FloaterSync behaviour via the Unity Inspector window or 'Component > Pokeyi.VRChat > P.VRC Floater Sync' toolbar menu.
- Click the 'Convert to UdonBehaviour' button if prompted.
- Click the small triangle next to Floater Objects to expand the array.
- If the Size field is left at 0, you can lock the Inspector tab and drag the game object(s) you want to manage into the Floater Objects label to add them all to the array at once. You can alternatively enter a Size value and drag them in one at a time. (See: Known Issues [#1](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Floater-Sync#known-issues))
- Configure the rest of the behaviour's properties in the Inspector window as you see fit. Each of these is explained in detail further below.
